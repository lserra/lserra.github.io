My name is Laercio, I am a data engineer with know-how and expertise in math, data, and coding.

Currently, I'm working and living in the City of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. When I am not with my family or my friends, I am programming, analyzing datasets, or studying mathematics. When I am not doing it all, I am listening to music, riding a bike/motorcycle, reading a book, drawing, or painting anything.

Nowadays, the volume of data produced by organizations is increasing year-by-year and these data are available or structured in many formats to be used in many forms with many tools.

Really, this is a too complex matrix: **[**  _data x form x tool_  **]**.

And I have another blog (the oldest blog), with a lot of information where I write about data engineering and data analytics related to BI and Big Data projects: [BI na Pr√°tica](http://binapratica.blogspot.com/).

In the future, this blog will be deactivated. I'm working on the migration to this new blog.

Thank you for visiting my blog!
